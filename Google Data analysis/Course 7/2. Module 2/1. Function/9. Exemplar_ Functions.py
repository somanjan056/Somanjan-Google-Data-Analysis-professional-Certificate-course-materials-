# <h1>Exemplar: Functions</h1>

# ## Introduction 
# 
# In this lab, you will practice defining functions and returning values, writing clean code, and using comments to scaffold code.
# 
# As a data professional, you'll often need to reuse the same block of code more than once when you're writing Python code to automate a certain task. This is why functions are important. You can call functions whenever you need the computer to execute those steps. Python has built-in functions that have already been defined and also provides tools for users to define their own functions.
# 
# In this activity, you'll continue your work as a junior data analyst for a movie theater. Your next task is to work with sales data. In particular, you'll define and call a function that calculates the revenue the theater makes depending on the number of tickets sold, then test the function with a new value.

# ## Tips for completing this lab
# 
# As you navigate this lab, keep the following tips in mind:
# 
# - `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` indicates where you should write code. Be sure to replace this with your own code before running the code cell.
# - Feel free to open the hints for additional guidance as you work on each task.
# - To enter your answer to a question, double-click the markdown cell to edit. Be sure to replace the "[Double-click to enter your responses here.]" with your own answer.
# - You can save your work manually by clicking File and then Save in the menu bar at the top of the notebook.
# - You can download your work locally by clicking File and then Download and then specifying your preferred file format in the menu bar at the top of the notebook.

# ## Task 1: Analyze a function
# 
# In your work as a data analyst for a movie theater, you're asked to quickly calculate how much the theater has made in sales so far.
# 
# In the following cell, analyze the function named `total_sales` and make note of your observations.
# 
# You do not need to run this cell, but if you do it will not produce an output.

# In[1]:


# Define a function named `total_sales`
def total_sales():

    # Return a value
    return

# 
# You can refer back to what you've learned about functions.
# 
# </details>

# <details>
#   <summary><h4><strong>Hint 2</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# When analyzing the function definition, make sure to observe the function body, which is the indented block of code after the function header.
# 
# </details>

# <details>
#   <summary><h4><strong>Hint 3</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# Notice that the code comments on each line clearly explain how the function operates.
# 
# Code comments can also be used to scaffold code as you build it, since Python will not interact with the text captured as a comment.
# 
# </details>

# ## Task 2: Add a parameter and calculations to the function
# 
# As you continue refining your code, imagine that the price of tickets is $7.99. Now you will need to add a parameter to the function definition and the calculation to the function body.
# 
# 

# ### 2a: Add a calculation to the function
# 
# In this task, update the `total_sales` function so it returns the value of the number of tickets `n` multiplied by the price `7.99`.

# In[2]:


# Add a parameter to the function
def total_sales(n):

    # Multiply the parameter by the ticket price to get total sales
    return n * 7.99


# ### 2b: Call the function
# 
# With the calculations added to the `total_sales` function, test it with a value of `59`.
# 
# *Example:*
# 
# ```
# [IN]  total_sales(59)
# [OUT] 471.41
# ```

# In[3]:


# Call the function
total_sales(59)

#   <summary><h4><strong>Hint 1</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# You can refer back to what you learned about functions and arithmetic operators.
# 
# </details>

# <details>
#   <summary><h4><strong>Hint 2</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# To create a function, use the `def` keyword to define the function, then write the name of the function, followed by parentheses and a colon: `():`. This set of parentheses is where a parameter would be added.
# 
# The body of the function begins on the next line and is indented, conventionally by four spaces. This is where to write the function's operations (such as arithmetic calculations) and a `return` statement.
# 
# To call a function, type the function name followed by parentheses, with a parameter in the parentheses.
# 
# </details>

# <details>
#   <summary><h4><strong>Hint 3</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# After defining the `total_sales` function, add a parameter `n` to the function.
# 
# In the body of the function, multiply the parameter by the ticket price to get total sales.
# 
# To call the function, replace `n` with the number of tickets in the function's parenthesis, then run the cell.
# 
# </details>

# # Task 3: Create a function that accepts two values
# 
# You learn that the price of tickets is more expensive for opening night, and now you need to create a function that will accept two values and return their total value.

# ### 3a: Refine the `total_sales` function
# 
# *  Update your `total_sales` function so it accepts two parameters:
#     * `price` for the price per ticket
#     * `num_tickets` for the total number of tickets.
# 
# * Return the product of the two arguments. Use the Python `round()` function to round the returned value to two decimal places. Refer to the [round() Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round) for more information regarding this function.

# In[4]:


# Refine the `total_sales` function
def total_sales(price, num_tickets):
    return round(price * num_tickets, 2)


# ### 3b: Call the function
# 
# Then, call the function with the value of `15.99` for `price` and `1001` for the number of tickets sold (`num_tickets`).
# 
# Example:
# 
# ```
# [IN]  total_sales(15.99, 1001)
# [OUT] 16005.99
# ```

# In[5]:


# Call the function with two values
total_sales(15.99, 1001)


# <details>
#   <summary><h4><strong>Hint 1</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# Refer to what you learned about functions, arithmetic operators, and the `round()` function.
# 
# </details>

# <details>
#   <summary><h4><strong>Hint 2</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# Defining up a function that accepts two parameters is a very similar process to defining a function with just one.
# 
# Begin by defining the function and naming it, but instead of a single parameter within the parentheses, place two parameters separated by a comma (`,`).
# 
# The body of the function is still on a new line and indented four spaces. The `round()` function is included here, and the calculation of the two parameters takes place within the `round()` function's parentheses.
# 
# When calling the new function, type the name of the function followed by a set of parentheses. Then, place the parameters that the function is operating on within the parentheses, separated by a comma.
# 
# </details>

# <details>
#   <summary><h4><strong>Hint 3</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# Define a function called `total_sales` that calculates the total dollar value of the tickets sold based on the per-ticket price (`price`), and the number of tickets sold (`num_tickets`).
# 
# In the body of the function, multiply the parameters to get the total and round the calculation to two decimal places.
# 
# To call the function, write the name of the function on a new line and replace the parameters with the price per ticket and number of tickets sold.
# 
# </details>

# ## Task 4: Test the function with different values
# 
# As prices and sales fluctate, your function will need to accept different values and still return the total sales.
# 
# In this task, practice calling your function with different values.
# 
# Example:
# 
# ```
# [IN]  total_sales(16.99, 1232)
# [OUT] 20931.68
# 
# [IN]  total_sales(10.50, 1472)
# [OUT] 15456.0
# 
# [IN]  total_sales(5.00, 349)
# [OUT] 1745.0
# 
# ```

# In[6]:


# Call `total_sales` with 16.99 price and 1232 num_tickets
total_sales(16.99, 1232)


# In[7]:


# Call `total_sales` with 10.50 price and 1472 num_tickets
total_sales(10.50, 1472)


# In[8]:


# Call `total_sales` with 5.00 price and 349 num_tickets
total_sales(5.00, 349)

#   <summary><h4><strong>Hint 1</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# You can refer to what you've learned about calling functions with multiple parameters.
# 
# </details>

# <details>
#   <summary><h4><strong>Hint 2</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# Call the function by writing the name, followed by parenthesis. Write the two values you want to calculate inside the parenthesis, separated by a comma.
# 
# </details>

# <details>
#   <summary><h4><strong>Hint 3</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# To run the function and calculate a new total, call `total_sales()` and write `16.99, 1232` inside the parenthesis.
# 
# </details>

# ## Conclusion
# 
# **What are your key takeaways from this lab?**

# - Python allows you to define and call functions that you create.
# - The main components of a function are the definition statement, the body, and the output statement (usually `return` or `print`).
#     - The function header includes the `def` keyword, followed by the name of the function, followed by parantheses, followed by a colon.
#     - The function body includes an indented block of code that instructs the computer on what to do when the function is called.
#     - The output statement is what the function should produce as a result when executed.
# - Functions allow you to reuse common code.
#     - Frequently used calculations can be saved to a function and reused without writing out the equation multiple times.
# - Functions accept single or multiple parameters.
#     - Functions can be customized to accept more than one parameter and perform calculations on them, which allows greater flexibility when working with fluctuating values.
# - Including functions such as `round()` to the return statement helps keep calculated values tidy and easy to read.
# - Scaffolding functions with code comments helps improve readibility.
#     - Clearly commented code explains how the code works as well as the intended results.
