# <h1>Activity: Conditional Statements</h1>

# ## Introduction 
# 
# In this lab, you will practice using Python operators to perform operations between two variables and write conditional statements.
# 
# As a data professional, you'll use conditional statements in your approach to many different tasks using Python. Using Boolean values, conditional statements will determine how a code block is executed based on how a condition is met.
# 
# In this activity, you'll continue your work as a junior data analyst for a movie theater. Now, you're examining marketing campaigns. Your next task is to analyze user behavior to determine when a customer's activity has prompted a marketing email.
# 

# ## Tips for completing this lab
# 
# As you navigate this lab, keep the following tips in mind:
# 
# - `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` indicates where you should write code. Be sure to replace this with your own code before running the code cell.
# - Feel free to open the hints for additional guidance as you work on each task.
# - To enter your answer to a question, double-click the markdown cell to edit. Be sure to replace the "[Double-click to enter your responses here.]" with your own answer.
# - You can save your work manually by clicking File and then Save in the menu bar at the top of the notebook.
# - You can download your work locally by clicking File and then Download and then specifying your preferred file format in the menu bar at the top of the notebook.

# ## Task 1: Define a comparator function
# 
# You are a data professional for a movie theater, and your task is to use customers' purchasing data to determine whether or not to send them a marketing email.
# 
# *   Define a function called `send_email` that accepts the following arguments:
#     *  `num_visits` - the number of times a customer has visited the theater
#     *  `visits_email` - the minimum number of visits the customer must have made for them to receive a marketing email
# *   The function must print either: `Send email.` or `Not enough visits.`
# 
# *Example:*
# 
# ```
#  [IN] send_email(num_visits=3, visits_email=5)
# [OUT] 'Not enough visits.'
# 
#  [IN] send_email(num_visits=5, visits_email=5)
# [OUT] 'Send email.'
# ```
# 
# **Note that there is more than one way to solve this problem.**
# 

# In[1]:


def send_email(num_visits, visits_email):
    if (num_visits>= visits_email):
        print("Send Email")
    else:
        print("Not enough visits")


# <details>
#   <summary><h4><strong>Hint 1</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# Consider the syntax for defining a function. Remember: a function definition statement must include a `def` keyword, the function's name, and its arguments, followed by a colon.
# 
# </details>

# <details>
#   <summary><h4><strong>Hint 2</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# Recall Python's conditional and comparison operators.
# Check your indentation. Is your code indented properly?
# 
# </details>

# <details>
#   <summary><h4><strong>Hint 3</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# One approach is to compare `num_visits` to `visits_email` using the `>=` comparator.
# If `num_visits >= visits_email`, print `Send email.` Otherwise, print `Not enough visits.`.
# 
# </details>

# ### Test your function
# Test your function against the following cases by running the cell below.

# In[2]:


send_email(num_visits=3, visits_email=5)    # Should print 'Not enough visits.'
send_email(num_visits=5, visits_email=5)    # Should print 'Send email.'
send_email(num_visits=15, visits_email=10)  # Should print 'Send email.'


# ## Task 2: Add logical branching to your function
# 
# The theater is offering a promotion where customers who have visited the theater more than a designated number of times will also receive a coupon with their email. Update the function that you created above to include additional logical branching.
# 
# *   Include an additional argument `visits_coupon` that represents the minimum number of visits the customer must have made for them to receive a coupon with their email.
# 
# *   The function must print one of three possible messages:
#     1. `Send email with coupon.`
#     2. `Send email only.`
#     3. `Not enough visits.`
#     
# The minimum number of visits to receive a coupon will always be greater than the number to receive an email only. 
# 
# *Example:*
# 
# ```
#  [IN] send_email(num_visits=3, visits_email=5, visits_coupon=8)
# [OUT] 'Not enough visits.'
# 
#  [IN] send_email(num_visits=5, visits_email=5, visits_coupon=8)
# [OUT] `Send email only.`
# 
#  [IN] send_email(num_visits=8, visits_email=5, visits_coupon=8)
# [OUT] `Send email with coupon.`
# ```
# 
# **Note that there is more than one way to solve this problem.**

### YOUR CODE HERE ###


# <details>
#   <summary><h4><strong>Hint 1</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# Refer to what you've learned about conditional statements, logical operators, and comparison operators.
# 
# </details>

# <details>
#     <summary><h4><strong>Hint 2</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# Make sure your `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements are indented properly beneath the function's definition line.
# 
# Make sure your print statements are indented properly beneath each conditional statement.
# 
# Check syntax.
# 
# </details>

# <details>
#   <summary><h4><strong>Hint 3</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# One approach is to compare `num_visits` to both `visits_coupon` and `visits_email` using the `>=` comparator:
# 
# If `num_visits >= visits_coupon`, print `Send email with coupon.`
# Or else if `num_visits >= visits_email`, print `Send email only.`
# Otherwise, print `Not enough visits.`
# 
# </details>

# ### Test your function
# Test your function against the following cases by running the cell below.

# In[ ]:


send_email(num_visits=3, visits_email=5, visits_coupon=8)   # Should print 'Not enough visits.'
send_email(num_visits=5, visits_email=5, visits_coupon=8)   # Should print 'Send email only.'
send_email(num_visits=6, visits_email=5, visits_coupon=8)   # Should print 'Send email only.'
send_email(num_visits=8, visits_email=5, visits_coupon=8)   # Should print 'Send email with coupon.'
send_email(num_visits=10, visits_email=5, visits_coupon=8)  # Should print 'Send email with coupon.'
