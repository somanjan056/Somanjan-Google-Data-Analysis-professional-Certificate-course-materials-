# <summary><h1>Activity: While loops</h1></summary>

# ## Introduction 
# 
# In this lab, you will practice using while loops to iterate through data and perform repeated comparisons.
# 
# Data analysts often work with code that requires repetition. In Python, iterative statements can help automate repetitive processes to make them more efficient.
# 
# In this activity, you will continue your work as a junior data analyst for a movie theater. You have now transitioned fully into marketing. One of your tasks is analyzing customer purchases at the concession stand and automating messages to alert staff when a customer has earned a coupon.

# ## Tips for completing this lab
# 
# As you navigate this lab, keep the following tips in mind:
# 
# - `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` indicates where you should write code. Be sure to replace this with your own code before running the code cell.
# - Feel free to open the hints for additional guidance as you work on each task.
# - To enter your answer to a question, double-click the markdown cell to edit. Be sure to replace the "[Double-click to enter your responses here.]" with your own answer.
# - You can save your work manually by clicking File and then Save in the menu bar at the top of the notebook.
# - You can download your work locally by clicking File and then Download and then specifying your preferred file format in the menu bar at the top of the notebook.

# ## Task 1: Iterate with a `while` loop
# 
# While continuing your work as an analyst for a movie theater, you've been asked to create a function that will require a `while` loop. To prepare for the job, first practice using `while` loops.
# 
# In this warmup task:
# 
# * Create a variable called `candy_purchased` that will act as a counter. Initialize it with a starting value of `0`.
# * Write a `while` loop that will continue iterating until `5` candies have been purchased.
#     * Each iteration of the loop must print `'Candy purchased: {number}'` and increment `candy_purchased` by one.
# 
# *Expected output:*
# ```
# Candy purchased: 0
# Candy purchased: 1
# Candy purchased: 2
# Candy purchased: 3
# Candy purchased: 4
# Candy purchased: 5
# ```

# <details>
#     <summary><h4><strong>Hint 1</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# Refer back to what you learned about iterating using `while` loops and comparison operators.
# 
# </details>

# <details>
#     <summary><h4><strong>Hint 2</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# * After creating a counter variable, you can use a `while` loop to iterate while a condition is true.
# 
# * Check your syntax and indentation.
# 
# * Make sure to increment the `candy_purchased` counter with each iteration of the loop.
# 
# * If your output isn't matching the example output, reconsider the order of your operations in the body of the `while` loop.
# 
# </details>

# <details>
#     <summary><h4><strong>Hint 3</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# * The `while` statement can be declared either for `candy_purchased <= 5` or `candy_purchased < 6`.
# 
# * For each iteration:
#     * First, print `'Candy purchased: {number}'`
#     * Then, increment `candy_purchased` by one
# 
# </details>

# # Task 2: Iterate using `while` and `if`
# 
# In the next warmup task, you'll use a `while` loop that has an `if` statement and some Boolean logic.
# 
# * Write a `while` loop where `candy_purchased` begins at `0` and stops after 100 purchases have been made. Your code must:
#     * Increment `candy_purchased` by one with each iteration
#     * Print `'Candy purchased: {number}'` only when a multiple of 10 purchases have been made
# 
# *Expected output:*
# ```
# Candy purchased: 0
# Candy purchased: 10
# Candy purchased: 20
# Candy purchased: 30
# Candy purchased: 40
# Candy purchased: 50
# Candy purchased: 60
# Candy purchased: 70
# Candy purchased: 80
# Candy purchased: 90
# Candy purchased: 100
# ```

#     <summary><h4><strong>Hint 2</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# After setting the counter to an initial value, initialize the `while` loop on a new line. Make sure the body of the while loop is indented. Additional iterative statements, such as `if`, are contained in the body of the loop and indented to the same level, though their own body is indented further.
#

#     <summary><h4><strong>Hint 3</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# * Define the `while` loop to execute until either `candy_purchased <= 100` or `candy_purchased < 101`.
# 
# * Begin the body with an `if` statement that uses the modulo operator to check the `candy_purchased` variable for perfect divisibility by 10 and execute the print statement only when the `if` statement evaluates to `True`.
# 
# * Finally, increment the `candy_purchased` counter by one.

# # Task 3: Create a webpage timer function
# 
# Now that you have some practice constructing `while` loops, it's time to take on the project you've been asked to complete for the theater.
# 
# This task makes use of a function called `sleep()` from the `time` module. Whenever `sleep(n)` is executed, the program will pause for `n` seconds. Run the below cell as an illustrative example to help you understand.

# In[ ]:


from time import sleep

n = 3
while n >= 0:
    print(n)
    sleep(1)    # Execution pauses for 1 second
    n = n - 1   # Decrement n by 1


# For the purposes of this task, pretend that 1 second = 1 minute, so the above cell would represent a 3-minute countdown.
# 
# The movie theater has implemented online reservations through their website. From the seat selection page, customers have a limited amount of time to make their selection. You must write a function that counts down and reminds the user that they have limited time to make a selection. When time expires, it must print a timeout message.
# 
# *  Instantiate a variable called `mins` and assign it a starting value of `10`.
# *  Write a `while` loop that uses the `sleep()` function and decrements `mins` from `10` minutes. For each minute:
# 
#     *  Print how many minutes remain as an integer. <br/>**BUT:**
#     *  If there are 5 minutes left, print `Place your reservation soon! 5 minutes remaining.` instead of the integer.
#     *  If there are 2 minutes left, print `Don't lose your seats! 2 minutes remaining.` instead of the integer.
#     *  When zero minutes remain, print `User timed out.` instead of the integer.
# 
# *Expected output:*
# 
# ```
# 10
# 9
# 8
# 7
# 6
# Place your reservation soon! 5 minutes remaining.
# 4
# 3
# Don't lose your seats! 2 minutes remaining.
# 1
# User timed out.
# ```
# 
# **Note that there is more than one way to solve this problem.**

from time import sleep

### YOUR CODE HERE ###


# <details><summary><h4><strong>Hint 1</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# *  There are four possible print statements to consider for each minute. Consider an if, elif, elif, else branching scheme.
# 
# *  Test for the special cases first (`mins == 5`, `mins == 2`, `mins == 0`).
# 
# </details>

# <details><summary><h4><strong>Hint 2</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# *  If your code is stuck in an infinite loop, check to make sure that you're decrementing the `mins` variable by one each time a condition that causes a print statement is satisfied.
# 
# *  If you're having trouble with the `sleep()` function, try writing the code without it. If you can get the code to work without it, experiment with adding the `sleep()` function in different places to see how it affects the code's execution.
# 
# </details>

# <details><summary><h4><strong>Hint 3</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# One approach is to set a `while` loop to execute when `mins >= 0`. For each iteration:
#     
# * Check if `mins == 5`. If it does, print the designated message, then decrement `mins` by one and sleep(1).
# * Check if `mins == 2`. If it does, print the designated message, then decrement `mins` by one and sleep(1).
# * Check if `mins == 0`. If it does, print the designated message, then decrement `mins` by one.
# * If none of the above conditions are met, print `mins`, decrement its value by one, and sleep(1).
